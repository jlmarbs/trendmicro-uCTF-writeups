# DESCRIPTION

We are provided with a `.pdf` file and is tasked to unlock the password on the `.pdf` file to get the flag.

## MY PROCESS

This was the most funniest challenge I did since it didn't really require complex things (at least for my process). What I did is that, I went to this website `https://www.ilovepdf.com/unlock_pdf` and selected the `.pdf` file given to the challenge. After downloading the decrypted `.pdf` file and opening it, this was the output:

Flag: `TMCTF{C0sm0s}`
