# DESCRIPTION

We are provided with a `.dat4` file, and we are tasked to find the flag there.

## MY PROCESS

I searched online on how to open a `.dat4` file, and it can be opened through text editors.

But from what I did, I opened it using `VSCode`, and this is the result:

After that, what I did is that I just `Ctrl + F` and searched for `TMCTF`. This is the result:

That is the flag for that challenge.

Flag: `TMCTF{Vultur3}`
